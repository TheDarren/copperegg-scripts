The scripts in this directory are used with CopperEgg pro mode to work-around
not being able to exclude certain filesystems or set specific alert thresholds
for certain filesystems.

The way this works on Linux is:
- puppet creates /etc/check_disk.conf for overrides.
- puppet installs nagios plugins (for /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_disk)
- puppet installs scripts in /usr/local/bin/ and a cron job every 5min.
- Configure each host in CopperEgg so it is using pro mode.
- Configure CopperEgg to alert if the process list does not contain "runWhileFile /var/tmp/check_disk".
